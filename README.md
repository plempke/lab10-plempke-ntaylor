#Welcome, this is my Markdown for Lab1

#Part2 Discussion: What would be a really simple solution if n were not an argument?
#if we were to write a solution without n we could just as easily set our for loop to run
#until it reached 17 and set our logical values to their respective modulators and 
# print off the output for our integers, Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz respectively

#Part3 Discussion: How could you have automatically tested your initial solution from part 2?
#You could have set a value to your variable n and ran the program as is to see if the result was correct

#Part4 Discussion: What changes between parts 2, 3, and 4, and what stays the same? Does it matter what implementation you choose? if so, in what way?

#between parts 2 and 3 instead of having my program print off the resulting value in the string I had it return the instance of the array
#from parts 3 to 4 *I no longer had an array as the returning object*. I was able to have it store my information by using a java collections
#and in turn *creating a list that stored my data*.
 
#throughout all of this my logic remainded the same
 
#With regards to which implementation, as you progress through each part the code that is being executed becomes more and **more sophisticated**
#you transition from printing off a string, to returning an array, to returning a list; which is superior to an array for it's versitility
