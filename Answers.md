Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.

A. Real world maps have water, a fifth color for that would be pretty nice.
B. If a nation has land under it's control that is entirely separated from the mainland geographically, it may require a fifth color
C. If a nation surrounds a group of nations, it may need a fifth color to keep it's color separate from the group of nations inside the surrounding nation
